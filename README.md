Continuous time stochastic processes
---

In this part of the subject, we have made two assignments:

- In the first one, we studied **arrival processes**, **Poisson processes** and, later, we simulated **Wiener processes** and their generalization: **the Brownian motion** (Folder [P1](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pe-continuo/tree/main/P1))

- In the second one, we perform simulations using algorithms that estimate the solutions of **stochastic differential equations** (Folder [P2](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pe-continuo/tree/main/P2))

Lastly, we include in this repository the resolution made by each of us of the final exams of the subjects, both the exam of the academic year 2020-2021 (made to practise for our final exam, incomplete) and our own exam in the academic year 2021-2022.
